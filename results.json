        "Title": "In Memoriam: Hugh Hancock",
        "Meta Description": "\r\nOn Monday morning, I was swapping texts with an old friend, Hugh Hancock.  The basic gist of those texts was \u00e2\u0080\u009csorry we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch up tonight, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll catch you in a few months\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nI never will.  He died suddenly, that evening, of a heart attack, aged just 40.\nTo say he accomplished a lot in his far-too-short life is to undersell it.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he knew the meaning of the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpossible\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Or anything like them.  For as long as I knew him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d parked himself on the bleeding edge of technology and storytelling, and he was always doing something that no-one else was.  It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always perfect.  It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always polished.  But no-one else was doing it.  So he did.\nHis career took him all over the world, to speak and lecture.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been sorry that I never actually got to see him do that professionally, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he was great at it.  You only had to talk to him for five minutes before you saw his passion and heart, and it was bloody infectious.  He poured it into everything he did, and he brought people along with him.\nIn the process of this, he named an art-form, Machinima, and made the first feature-length film in it, at a time when every else who was making Machinima thought they were doing well to make a five minute comedy short.  When he concluded that one of the things that was letting his film-making down was the quality of the voice talent, he went out and booked Brian Blessed, Joanna Lumley, Jack Davenport and Anna Chancellor for his next work.  I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite know how he managed it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure he knew how he managed it.\nI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say that Machinima wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look the same without him.  And as if one art form wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough, in the last few years, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d turned his attention to VR games, and storytelling.  Lacking the equipment to do so, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played his effort in that field but from the reaction to it, and it sounds like he hit exactly the mark he was aiming for, and showed people that yes, you can use VR games as a narrative form.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read a bunch of the tributes to him, from his friends and from strangers who only knew him through his work, and of all of them there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a comment on a facebook thread made by his close friend Johnnie Ingram (whose own tribute to Hugh is singularly perfect), noting \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe number of people saying some variation of \u00e2\u0080\u0098he quite literally changed my life\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is extraordinary\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very true, and is absolutely the measure of the man.\nBut as I remarked elsewhere, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not his achievements I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be my my funny, warm, kind friend.  \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the lunatic who decided he wanted to cook sous-vide at home, years before you could buy a home sous-vide device, so dragooned an engineer friend into helping him hack about with a slow cooker and an electric thermocouple, to create the monstrosity of wiring and water that he dubbed his \u00e2\u0080\u009catomic crockpot\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  (He did not know the meaning of the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpossible\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  He may sometimes have been hazy on the meaning of the word \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety\u00e2\u0080\u009d.)\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the man who reduced me to tears of helpless laughter describing the process of drying duck for a banquet between two computer fans.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the man who I could (and did) talk about anything with, and be assured that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just get it.  Whatever it was.  The friend who I might not see for months or years at a stretch, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d meet, and five minutes later, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be like no time had passed.\nOn Monday morning, when he texted to cancel, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t upset. I was sure that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see him  in a few months time, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be like no time had passed.\nIt is so unfair that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer true, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the words.  \nHe was 40.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done so much, and still I am sure his best work was ahead of him.  The world has lost a brilliant and kind man, and many, many people have lost a dear friend.  My love and sympathy goes out to everyone that knew him, most especially his partner, and the rest of his family.\n\t\r\n\t"
